## Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called machine-learning-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Give each model you choose their own Jupyter notebook, do not use more than one model per notebook.
4. Save your best model to a file. This will be the model used to test your accuracy and used for grading.
5. Commit your Jupyter notebooks and model file and push them to GitHub.
